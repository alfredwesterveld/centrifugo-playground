Just playing around with [centrifugo](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifugo) for now.

download centrifugo release for your OS from there [release](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifugo/releases) page.

Run `./centrifugo --config=config.json --insecure=true -a localhost`

I am playing around so only bind to localhost.
See the issue below. I might fork this project if not fixed?
